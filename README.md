I think the subject System Integration and Architecture might be a little hard because it sounds very technical. It deals with how different systems connect and work together, which feels kind of complicated to understand at first. It might also include lessons that need a lot of focus since itâ€™s not just about one program but how different parts of a system work as a whole.

Even though it seems challenging, I know this subject will be useful in the future. Learning about how systems connect and communicate can help us in real-life situations, especially in technology and business. It will also train us to think carefully and solve problems, which is something we can use even outside the classroom.

What makes me less worried is that I know my classmates are supportive and willing to help each other. Whenever something is difficult, we can work together, share ideas, and explain things to one another. Because of that, I believe we can get through this subject as a group, and it might even be fun to learn together.
